Based on studying all the data from your project, I've created a **comprehensive, automated solution** that combines all the steps into organized shell scripts. Here's your complete **end-to-end Kubernetes Master Node setup with kubeaudit**:

# **Complete Kubernetes Master Node Solution**

## **📋 What You Get:**
1. **Master Node Complete Setup Script** - Installs everything
2. **Worker Node Setup Script** - Prepares worker nodes  
3. **Verification Script** - Tests cluster health
4. **Helper Commands** - Easy-to-use security scanning

## **🚀 Quick Start - Master Node**

### **Step 1: Download and Run Master Setup**

```bash
# Make script executable and run
chmod +x k8s-master-complete-setup.sh
sudo ./k8s-master-complete-setup.sh
```

**This single script does EVERYTHING:**
- ✅ System preparation (swap, modules, sysctl)
- ✅ containerd installation and configuration  
- ✅ Kubernetes components (kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl)
- ✅ Cluster initialization with proper settings
- ✅ Calico CNI network setup
- ✅ kubeaudit security scanner installation
- ✅ Helper scripts and sample files

### **Step 2: Verify Installation**

```bash
chmod +x k8s-verify-cluster.sh
./k8s-verify-cluster.sh
```

## **🛠️ What Each Script Does:**

### **Master Node Script Features:**
- **Automated downloads** with latest versions
- **Error handling** - stops on any failure
- **Color-coded output** for easy reading
- **Progress tracking** through 7 phases
- **Automatic join command** saving
- **Security scanner** integration
- **Sample files** for testing

### **Built-in Helper Commands:**
After setup, you get these easy commands:

```bash
# Scan entire cluster for security issues
k8s-security-scan cluster

# Scan a manifest file before deployment  
k8s-security-scan manifest myapp.yml

# Auto-fix security issues in manifest
k8s-security-scan autofix myapp.yml
```

## **📊 Complete Process Flow:**

| Phase | What It Does | Time |
|-------|--------------|------|
| **Phase 1** | System prep (swap, modules, sysctl) | 2-3 min |
| **Phase 2** | containerd + runc + CNI installation | 3-4 min |
| **Phase 3** | Kubernetes tools installation | 2-3 min |
| **Phase 4** | Cluster initialization + Calico | 5-7 min |
| **Phase 5** | kubeaudit security scanner | 1-2 min |
| **Phase 6** | Helper scripts + samples | 1 min |
| **Phase 7** | Verification + join command | 1-2 min |

**Total Time: ~15-20 minutes**

## **🔧 Worker Node Setup (Bonus)**

```bash
# On each worker node
chmod +x k8s-worker-setup.sh
sudo ./k8s-worker-setup.sh

# Then use the join command from master node output
sudo kubeadm join :6443 --token  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256: --ignore-preflight-errors=NumCPU,Mem
```

## **🔍 Security Scanning Examples:**

After setup, you can immediately start security scanning:

```bash
# Scan your cluster
k8s-security-scan cluster

# Test with sample pod
k8s-security-scan manifest sample-pod.yml

# Auto-fix the sample pod
k8s-security-scan autofix sample-pod.yml
```

## **✅ Success Indicators:**

After running the master script, you should see:
- **Nodes**: `kubectl get nodes` shows master as `Ready`
- **Pods**: All system pods in `Running` state
- **kubeaudit**: Version displayed correctly
- **Join command**: Saved in `/tmp/kubeadm-join-command.txt`

## **🚨 Key Advantages of This Solution:**

1. **Single Command Setup** - Everything automated
2. **Error Recovery** - Script stops on failures
3. **Latest Versions** - Uses current stable releases
4. **Security First** - Built-in kubeaudit integration
5. **Production Ready** - Proper systemd cgroup driver
6. **Easy Scaling** - Worker script for expansion
7. **Comprehensive** - Covers all your course requirements

## **💡 Usage After Setup:**

```bash
# Check cluster health anytime
./k8s-verify-cluster.sh

# Quick security scan
k8s-security-scan cluster

# Deploy and scan applications
kubectl apply -f myapp.yml
k8s-security-scan cluster
```

This solution **eliminates all manual steps**, **reduces errors**, and gives you a **fully functional Kubernetes cluster with security scanning** in under 20 minutes. The scripts handle all the complex configuration details from your course automatically!
